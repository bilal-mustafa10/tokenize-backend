It allows the lender to provide a specified loan amount to the borrower, who is then responsible for repaying the loan with interest within a defined term.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to automate the process of loan issuance and repayment, ensuring that both parties adhere to the terms of the agreement. By utilizing blockchain technology, the contract provides transparency, security, and immutability to the loan process, reducing the need for intermediaries.\n\n## Objectives\nThe objectives of the `LoanContract` include:\n- **Facilitating Loan Transactions:** Enable lenders to provide loans and borrowers to receive funds in a secure manner.\n- **Automating Repayment:** Ensure that the repayment process is straightforward and automated, minimizing the risk of default.\n- **Tracking Loan Status:** Maintain a clear record of the loan status, including whether it is active, repaid, or defaulted.\n- **Event Emission:** Provide real-time updates to the blockchain regarding loan initiation and repayment through events.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` encompasses several key functionalities:\n- **Initialization:** The contract is initialized with the lender's address (the deployer) and the borrower's address, along with predefined loan parameters such as amount, interest rate, and term.\n- **Loan Initiation:** The borrower can initiate the loan, which triggers an event to notify the blockchain of the loan details.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The contract includes a function to calculate the total repayment amount, which includes the principal and interest, ensuring the borrower is aware of their obligations.\n- **Loan Repayment:** The borrower can repay the loan by sending the correct amount of Ether, which updates the loan status to 'Repaid' and emits a repayment event.\n- **Default Handling:** The lender has the ability to handle default scenarios, allowing them to change the loan status to 'Defaulted' if necessary.\n\n## Events\nThe `LoanContract` emits the following events:\n- **LoanInitiated:** This event is emitted when the borrower initiates the loan, providing details such as the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** This event is emitted when the borrower successfully repays the loan, indicating the amount repaid.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and providing clear mechanisms for initiation, repayment, and default handling, it enhances the efficiency and security of peer-to-peer lending. The use of events further ensures transparency and real-time tracking of loan activities, making it a valuable tool for both lenders and borrowers.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables\n    address public lender;\n    address public borrower;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanTerm;\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Defaulted }\n    LoanStatus public status;\n\n    // Events\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan contract\n    constructor(address _borrower) {\n        lender = msg.sender; // The lender is the contract deployer\n        borrower = _borrower;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // Loan amount of 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // Interest rate of 3%\n        loanTerm = 365 days; // Loan term of 1 year\n        status = LoanStatus.Active; // Initial loan status\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() public {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can initiate the loan.\");\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount after 1 year\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() public view returns (uint) {\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function for the borrower to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() public payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = calculateTotalRepayment();\n        require(msg.value == totalRepayment, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n        status = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle default scenarios\n    function handleDefault() public {\n        require(msg.sender == lender, \"Only the lender can handle defaults.\");\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        // Implement default handling logic here (e.g., penalties)\n        status = LoanStatus.Defaulted;\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
