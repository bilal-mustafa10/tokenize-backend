The contract allows the borrower to take out a loan from the lender, specifying the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. It also provides functionalities for loan initiation, repayment, and status checking.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to create a transparent and secure mechanism for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By utilizing smart contract technology, it ensures that the terms of the loan are enforced automatically, reducing the need for intermediaries and minimizing the risk of default.\n\n## Objectives\nThe contract aims to achieve the following objectives:\n- **Facilitate Loan Transactions:** Enable borrowers to request loans and lenders to provide them in a secure manner.\n- **Automate Loan Management:** Automatically handle loan initiation, repayment, and status updates without manual intervention.\n- **Ensure Transparency:** Provide clear visibility into the loan terms and status for both parties involved.\n- **Minimize Default Risk:** Establish a clear process for loan repayment to mitigate the risk of default.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Constructor:** Initializes the contract with the borrower's address, sets the lender as the contract deployer, and defines the loan parameters (amount, interest rate, and term).\n- **Initiate Loan:** Allows the borrower to initiate the loan, emitting an event to signal the loan initiation.\n- **Calculate Total Repayment:** Computes the total amount that the borrower must repay after the loan term, including interest.\n- **Repay Loan:** Enables the borrower to repay the loan, ensuring that the repayment amount meets the calculated total. Upon successful repayment, the loan status is updated.\n- **Check Loan Status:** Provides a method for any party to check the current status of the loan (Active, Repaid, or Defaulted).\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits the following events:\n- **LoanInitiated:** This event is emitted when the borrower initiates the loan, providing details such as the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** This event is emitted when the borrower successfully repays the loan, indicating the total amount repaid.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a foundational tool for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and ensuring transparency, it provides a reliable framework for borrowers and lenders to engage in financial transactions. The contract's design minimizes the risk of default and enhances the overall efficiency of loan management.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\n/**\n * @title LoanContract\n * @dev A simple loan contract that allows a borrower to take a loan from a lender.\n */\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanTerm;\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Defaulted }\n    LoanStatus public status;\n\n    // Events\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint totalAmount);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Constructor to initialize the loan contract.\n     * @param _borrower The address of the borrower.\n     */\n    constructor(address _borrower) {\n        lender = msg.sender; // The lender is the one who deploys the contract\n        borrower = _borrower; // Set the borrower address\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanTerm = 365 days; // 1 year\n        status = LoanStatus.Active; // Initial loan status\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to initiate the loan.\n     * Only the borrower can initiate the loan.\n     */\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can initiate the loan.\");\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to calculate total repayment amount after 1 year.\n     * @return totalRepayment The total amount to be repaid.\n     */\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() public view returns (uint) {\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to allow the borrower to repay the loan.\n     * Only the borrower can repay the loan.\n     */\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = calculateTotalRepayment();\n        require(msg.value >= totalRepayment, \"Insufficient funds to repay the loan.\");\n        status = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, totalRepayment);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to check loan status.\n     * @return status The current status of the loan.\n     */\n    function getLoanStatus() external view returns (LoanStatus) {\n        return status;\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
