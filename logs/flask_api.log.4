The contract manages the loan lifecycle, including initiation, repayment, and tracking of loan status.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to provide a transparent and secure mechanism for individuals to engage in lending and borrowing activities on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures that both parties are aware of the terms of the loan and provides a structured process for repayment.\n\n## Objectives\nThe contract aims to achieve the following objectives:\n- **Facilitate Loan Transactions:** Enable borrowers to request loans and lenders to provide funds securely.\n- **Manage Loan Terms:** Define and enforce loan parameters such as amount, interest rate, and duration.\n- **Track Loan Status:** Maintain a record of whether a loan is active or has been repaid.\n- **Handle Late Payments:** Provide a mechanism for borrowers to report late payments and manage potential penalties.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Loan Initialization:** The borrower can initiate a loan request, which sets the loan parameters and marks the loan as active.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The contract allows the borrower to calculate the total repayment amount, which includes the principal and interest.\n- **Loan Repayment:** The borrower can repay the loan by sending the exact repayment amount, which deactivates the loan and updates its status.\n- **Remaining Balance Inquiry:** The borrower can check the remaining balance of the loan, which reflects the total repayment minus any payments made.\n- **Late Payment Handling:** The borrower can report a late payment, triggering an event for tracking purposes.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits the following events to provide transparency and track important actions:\n- **LoanInitiated:** Emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, capturing the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** Emitted when the loan is repaid, indicating the amount paid by the borrower.\n- **LatePayment:** Emitted when the borrower reports a late payment, allowing for tracking of such occurrences.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and ensuring transparency through events, it provides a secure environment for both borrowers and lenders. The contract's functionalities not only facilitate the lending process but also promote accountability and trust between parties.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanDuration;\n    uint public totalRepayment;\n    bool public loanActive;\n\n    // Mapping to track loan status\n    mapping(address => bool) public loanStatus;\n\n    // Events\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n    event LatePayment(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan parameters\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanDuration = 365 days; // 1 year\n        loanActive = false;\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(msg.sender != lender, \"Lender cannot be the borrower.\");\n        require(!loanActive, \"Loan is already active.\");\n\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        loanActive = true;\n        totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(msg.value == totalRepayment, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus[borrower] = true;\n\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to check remaining balance of the loan\n    function remainingBalance() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment - address(this).balance;\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle late payments\n    function handleLatePayment() external {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only borrower can report late payment.\");\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n\n        // Logic for handling late payment (e.g., penalties)\n        // For simplicity, we just emit an event\n        emit LatePayment(borrower, totalRepayment);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
