It provides a structured framework for initiating loans, calculating repayment amounts, and managing the loan lifecycle, including handling late payments.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to create a transparent and secure mechanism for peer-to-peer lending on the Ethereum blockchain. By utilizing smart contracts, it eliminates the need for intermediaries, thereby reducing costs and increasing trust between parties involved in the loan agreement.\n\n## Objectives\nThe contract aims to achieve the following objectives:\n- **Facilitate Loan Transactions:** Enable users to initiate and manage loans directly on the blockchain.\n- **Automate Repayment Calculations:** Automatically calculate the total repayment amount based on the loan amount and interest rate.\n- **Track Loan Status:** Maintain a clear record of the loan status, including whether it is active, repaid, or late.\n- **Handle Late Payments:** Provide functionality to manage and record late payments, ensuring accountability for borrowers.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Loan Initialization:** The lender can set up a loan by specifying the loan amount, interest rate, and term. The borrower can then initiate the loan.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The contract allows the borrower to view the total repayment amount required for the loan.\n- **Loan Repayment:** Borrowers can repay the loan in full, and the contract verifies the repayment amount and deadline before processing the transaction.\n- **Remaining Balance Inquiry:** Users can check the remaining balance of the loan while it is active.\n- **Late Payment Management:** The contract can handle late payments by updating the loan status and emitting an event to notify stakeholders.\n\n## Events\nThe `LoanContract` emits several events to provide transparency and track important actions within the contract:\n- **LoanInitiated:** Emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, capturing the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** Emitted when the loan is repaid, indicating the amount repaid by the borrower.\n- **LatePayment:** Emitted when a payment is considered late, documenting the amount that was due.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust solution for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating key processes and providing clear visibility into loan status and repayment obligations, it enhances the lending experience for both borrowers and lenders. The contract's design promotes trust and accountability, making it a valuable tool for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables to store loan details\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanTerm;\n    bool public loanActive;\n    uint public totalRepayment;\n    uint public repaymentAmount;\n    uint public repaymentDeadline;\n\n    // Enum to track loan status\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Late }\n    LoanStatus public loanStatus;\n\n    // Event emitted when the loan is initiated\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    // Event emitted when the loan is repaid\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n    // Event emitted when a payment is late\n    event LatePayment(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan details\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanTerm = 365 days; // 1 year\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Active;\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(!loanActive, \"Loan is already active.\");\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        loanActive = true;\n        totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        repaymentAmount = totalRepayment; // Full repayment amount after 1 year\n        repaymentDeadline = block.timestamp + loanTerm;\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(msg.value == repaymentAmount, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n        require(block.timestamp <= repaymentDeadline, \"Payment is late.\");\n\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to check remaining balance of the loan\n    function remainingBalance() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment - repaymentAmount;\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle late payments\n    function handleLatePayment() external {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(block.timestamp > repaymentDeadline, \"Payment is not late.\");\n\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Late;\n        emit LatePayment(borrower, repaymentAmount);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
