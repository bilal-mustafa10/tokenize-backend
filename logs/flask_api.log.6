It allows the borrower to take out a loan and provides the lender with the ability to withdraw funds once the loan is repaid. The contract incorporates essential features such as loan initiation, repayment, and fund withdrawal, ensuring a structured approach to managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to create a transparent and secure mechanism for managing loans between two parties. By leveraging blockchain technology, the contract ensures that all transactions are recorded immutably, providing both the borrower and lender with confidence in the loan process. The contract aims to eliminate the need for intermediaries, thereby reducing costs and increasing efficiency in loan management.\n\n## Objectives\nThe objectives of the `LoanContract` include:\n- **Facilitating Loan Agreements:** Enable borrowers to request loans and lenders to provide them in a secure manner.\n- **Ensuring Transparency:** Maintain a clear record of loan terms, repayments, and statuses, accessible to both parties.\n- **Automating Processes:** Streamline the loan initiation, repayment, and fund withdrawal processes through automated functions.\n- **Managing Loan Status:** Track the status of the loan (active, repaid, or defaulted) to inform both parties of the current state of the agreement.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` encompasses several key functionalities:\n- **Constructor:** Initializes the contract with the borrower's address, sets the lender as the contract deployer, and defines the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and initial status.\n- **Initiate Loan:** Allows the borrower to initiate the loan, emitting an event to signal the initiation.\n- **Calculate Total Repayment:** Computes the total amount to be repaid by the borrower, including the principal and interest, ensuring the loan is active before calculation.\n- **Repay Loan:** Enables the borrower to repay the loan, validating that the repayment amount meets or exceeds the total repayment amount. Upon successful repayment, the loan status is updated.\n- **Withdraw Funds:** Permits the lender to withdraw funds from the contract, ensuring that only the lender can perform this action and that there are available funds.\n- **Check Loan Status:** Provides a function for either party to check the current status of the loan.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits several events to notify parties of significant actions:\n- **LoanInitiated:** Emitted when the borrower initiates the loan, providing details about the borrower, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** Emitted when the borrower successfully repays the loan, detailing the total amount repaid.\n- **FundsWithdrawn:** Emitted when the lender withdraws funds from the contract, indicating the amount withdrawn.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating key processes and ensuring transparency, it provides a reliable solution for borrowers and lenders alike. The contract's design promotes trust and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\n/**\n * @title LoanContract\n * @dev A simple loan contract that allows a borrower to take a loan from a lender and also allows the lender to withdraw funds.\n */\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanTerm;\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Defaulted }\n    LoanStatus public status;\n\n    // Events\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint totalAmount);\n    event FundsWithdrawn(address indexed lender, uint amount);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Constructor to initialize the loan contract.\n     * @param _borrower The address of the borrower.\n     */\n    constructor(address _borrower) {\n        lender = msg.sender; // The lender is the one who deploys the contract\n        borrower = _borrower; // Set the borrower address\n        loanAmount = 2 ether; // 2 ETH\n        interestRate = 7; // 7%\n        loanTerm = 10 * 365 days; // 10 years\n        status = LoanStatus.Active; // Initial loan status\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to initiate the loan.\n     * Only the borrower can initiate the loan.\n     */\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can initiate the loan.\");\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to calculate total repayment amount after the loan term.\n     * @return totalRepayment The total amount to be repaid.\n     */\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() public view returns (uint) {\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to allow the borrower to repay the loan.\n     * Only the borrower can repay the loan.\n     */\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = calculateTotalRepayment();\n        require(msg.value >= totalRepayment, \"Insufficient funds to repay the loan.\");\n        status = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, totalRepayment);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to allow the lender to withdraw funds from the contract.\n     * Only the lender can withdraw funds.\n     */\n    function withdrawFunds() external {\n        require(msg.sender == lender, \"Only the lender can withdraw funds.\");\n        uint balance = address(this).balance;\n        require(balance > 0, \"No funds available to withdraw.\");\n        payable(lender).transfer(balance);\n        emit FundsWithdrawn(lender, balance);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Function to check loan status.\n     * @return status The current status of the loan.\n     */\n    function getLoanStatus() external view returns (LoanStatus) {\n        return status;\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
