It provides a structured framework for initiating loans, calculating repayment amounts, and managing the loan lifecycle, including handling late payments.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to create a transparent and secure mechanism for peer-to-peer lending on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to borrow funds with predefined terms, including interest rates and repayment deadlines, while ensuring that both parties are aware of their obligations.\n\n## Objectives\nThe contract aims to achieve the following objectives:\n- **Facilitate Loans:** Enable users to initiate and manage loans in a decentralized manner.\n- **Calculate Repayment:** Automatically calculate the total repayment amount based on the loan amount and interest rate.\n- **Track Loan Status:** Monitor the status of the loan, including whether it is active, repaid, or late.\n- **Handle Late Payments:** Provide a mechanism to manage late payments and notify the involved parties.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Loan Initialization:** The borrower can initiate a loan by calling the `initiateLoan` function, which sets the loan parameters and marks the loan as active.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The `calculateTotalRepayment` function allows users to view the total amount due for repayment while the loan is active.\n- **Loan Repayment:** The `repayLoan` function enables the borrower to repay the loan, ensuring that the correct amount is sent and that the payment is made before the deadline.\n- **Remaining Balance Inquiry:** The `remainingBalance` function provides the borrower with the remaining balance of the loan that needs to be repaid.\n- **Late Payment Handling:** The `handleLatePayment` function allows the contract to update the loan status to late if the repayment is not made by the deadline.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits several events to notify external listeners about significant actions:\n- **LoanInitiated:** Emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, providing details about the borrower, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** Emitted when the loan is fully repaid, indicating the amount repaid by the borrower.\n- **LatePayment:** Emitted when a payment is late, notifying that the borrower has missed the repayment deadline.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and providing clear mechanisms for repayment and late payment handling, it enhances the lending experience for both borrowers and lenders. This contract exemplifies the potential of smart contracts to facilitate financial transactions in a decentralized and trustless environment.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables to store loan details\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate; \n    uint public loanTerm;  \n    bool public loanActive;\n    uint public totalRepayment;\n    uint public repaymentAmount;\n    uint public repaymentDeadline;\n\n    // Enum to track loan status\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Late }\n    LoanStatus public loanStatus;\n\n    // Event emitted when the loan is initiated\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    // Event emitted when the loan is repaid\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n    // Event emitted when a payment is late\n    event LatePayment(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan details\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanTerm = 365 days; // 1 year\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Active;\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(!loanActive, \"Loan is already active.\");\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        loanActive = true;\n        totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        repaymentAmount = totalRepayment; // Full repayment amount after 1 year\n        repaymentDeadline = block.timestamp + loanTerm;\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(msg.value == repaymentAmount, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n        require(block.timestamp <= repaymentDeadline, \"Payment is late.\");\n\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to check remaining balance of the loan\n    function remainingBalance() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment - repaymentAmount;\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle late payments\n    function handleLatePayment() external {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(block.timestamp > repaymentDeadline, \"Payment is not late.\");\n\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Late;\n        emit LatePayment(borrower, repaymentAmount);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
