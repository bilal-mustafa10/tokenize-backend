It allows the borrower to initiate a loan, calculates the total repayment amount, and enables the borrower to repay the loan after a specified duration.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to provide a transparent and secure mechanism for managing loans on the blockchain. By utilizing smart contracts, the agreement between the lender and borrower is enforced programmatically, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust in the transaction.\n\n## Objectives\nThe objectives of the `LoanContract` include:\n- **Loan Management:** To manage the lifecycle of a loan, including initiation, repayment, and status tracking.\n- **Transparency:** To ensure that all terms of the loan, including amounts and interest rates, are clearly defined and immutable once the contract is deployed.\n- **Security:** To leverage blockchain technology to secure the loan agreement and protect against fraud.\n- **Automation:** To automate the loan repayment process, ensuring that repayments are only accepted under the correct conditions.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` provides several key functionalities:\n- **Initialization:** The contract is initialized with the borrower's address, loan amount, interest rate, and duration. The lender is set as the contract deployer.\n- **Loan Initiation:** The borrower can initiate the loan, which records the start time of the loan and emits an event to signal the initiation.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The contract includes a function to calculate the total repayment amount, which includes the principal and interest, based on the loan amount and interest rate.\n- **Loan Repayment:** The borrower can repay the loan after the loan duration has elapsed, provided they send the correct repayment amount. The loan status is updated upon successful repayment.\n\n## Events\nThe `LoanContract` emits the following events:\n- **LoanInitiated:** This event is emitted when the borrower initiates the loan, providing details such as the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** This event is emitted when the borrower successfully repays the loan, indicating the amount repaid.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and ensuring transparency and security, it provides a reliable solution for both lenders and borrowers. The use of smart contracts minimizes the risk of disputes and enhances the efficiency of loan transactions.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanStartTime;\n    uint public loanDuration;\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Paid, Defaulted }\n    LoanStatus public status;\n\n    // Events\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan contract\n    constructor(address _borrower) {\n        lender = msg.sender; // The contract deployer is the lender\n        borrower = _borrower;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanDuration = 365 days; // 1 year\n        status = LoanStatus.Active;\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can initiate the loan.\");\n        loanStartTime = block.timestamp;\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount after 1 year\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() public view returns (uint) {\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        require(block.timestamp >= loanStartTime + loanDuration, \"Loan period has not elapsed.\");\n        require(msg.value >= calculateTotalRepayment(), \"Insufficient amount to repay the loan.\");\n\n        // Update loan status\n        status = LoanStatus.Paid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
