2024-07-31 05:50:24,218 INFO: {"document": {"contract_type": null, "contract_requirements": null, "documentation": "# LoanContract Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThe `LoanContract` is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate a simple loan agreement between a borrower and a lender on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the borrower to initiate a loan, calculates the total repayment amount, and enables the borrower to repay the loan with interest.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to provide a transparent and secure mechanism for managing loans on the blockchain. It ensures that both parties\u2014the borrower and the lender\u2014are aware of the terms of the loan, including the amount, interest rate, and repayment conditions.\n\n## Objectives\nThe objectives of the `LoanContract` include:\n- **Loan Management:** To manage the lifecycle of a loan, from initiation to repayment.\n- **Transparency:** To provide clear terms and conditions for the loan, ensuring both parties understand their obligations.\n- **Security:** To leverage blockchain technology for secure transactions, reducing the risk of fraud.\n- **Automation:** To automate the calculation of repayment amounts and the status updates of the loan.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Loan Initialization:** The contract allows a borrower to initiate a loan by calling the `initiateLoan` function, which sets the borrower's address and emits a `LoanInitiated` event.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The `calculateTotalRepayment` function computes the total amount the borrower must repay after the loan term, including the principal and interest.\n- **Loan Repayment:** The `repayLoan` function enables the borrower to repay the loan. It checks that the borrower is the one repaying, verifies the loan status, and ensures sufficient funds are provided. Upon successful repayment, it updates the loan status to `Repaid` and emits a `LoanRepaid` event.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits the following events:\n- **LoanInitiated:** This event is emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, capturing the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** This event is emitted when the loan is repaid, capturing the borrower's address and the total repayment amount.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a foundational tool for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and ensuring transparency and security, it benefits both borrowers and lenders. The contract's functionalities streamline the loan lifecycle, making it easier for users to engage in lending and borrowing activities in a decentralized manner.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables to store loan details\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanTerm;\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Defaulted }\n    LoanStatus public status;\n\n    // Event emitted when the loan is initiated\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    // Event emitted when the loan is repaid\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan details\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // Loan amount of 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // Interest rate of 3%\n        loanTerm = 365 days; // Loan term of 1 year\n        status = LoanStatus.Active; // Initial loan status\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(borrower == address(0), \"Loan already initiated.\");\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount after 1 year\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() public view returns (uint) {\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to allow the borrower to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        uint totalRepayment = calculateTotalRepayment();\n        require(msg.value >= totalRepayment, \"Insufficient funds to repay the loan.\");\n\n        // Update loan status\n        status = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, totalRepayment);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
