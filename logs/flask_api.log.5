It allows the borrower to initiate a loan, repay it, and manage the loan's status while ensuring that the lender's interests are protected.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to provide a transparent and secure mechanism for managing loans. It enables borrowers to access funds while ensuring that lenders can track the loan's status and repayment. The contract automates the loan process, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust between parties.\n\n## Objectives\nThe objectives of the `LoanContract` include:\n- **Facilitating Loan Initiation:** Allowing borrowers to initiate a loan under predefined terms.\n- **Calculating Total Repayment:** Providing a method to calculate the total amount to be repaid, including interest.\n- **Managing Loan Repayment:** Enabling borrowers to repay the loan securely and ensuring that the loan status is updated accordingly.\n- **Tracking Loan Status:** Maintaining a record of whether the loan is active or has been repaid.\n- **Handling Late Payments:** Providing a mechanism to report and manage late payments, ensuring accountability.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Constructor:** Initializes the contract with the lender's address and sets default loan parameters such as amount, interest rate, and duration.\n- **Initiate Loan:** Allows a borrower to initiate a loan, ensuring that the lender cannot borrow from themselves and that no active loan exists.\n- **Calculate Total Repayment:** Computes the total repayment amount based on the loan amount and interest rate, accessible only when the loan is active.\n- **Repay Loan:** Facilitates the repayment of the loan by the borrower, ensuring that the correct amount is sent and updating the loan status.\n- **Remaining Balance:** Provides the remaining balance of the loan, allowing the borrower to track their repayment progress.\n- **Handle Late Payment:** Allows the borrower to report a late payment, with the potential for penalties or other actions to be defined in future iterations.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits several events to log important actions:\n- **LoanInitiated:** Emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, providing details about the borrower, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** Emitted when the loan is fully repaid, indicating the amount repaid by the borrower.\n- **LatePayment:** Emitted when a late payment is reported, allowing for tracking of such occurrences.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process and providing clear functionalities for both borrowers and lenders, it enhances transparency and trust in financial transactions. The contract's design allows for easy tracking of loan status and repayment, making it a valuable tool for peer-to-peer lending.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanDuration;\n    uint public totalRepayment;\n    bool public loanActive;\n\n    // Mapping to track loan status\n    mapping(address => bool) public loanStatus;\n\n    // Events\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n    event LatePayment(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan parameters\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanDuration = 365 days; // 1 year\n        loanActive = false;\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(msg.sender != lender, \"Lender cannot be the borrower.\");\n        require(!loanActive, \"Loan is already active.\");\n\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        loanActive = true;\n        totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(msg.value == totalRepayment, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus[borrower] = true;\n\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to check remaining balance of the loan\n    function remainingBalance() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment - address(this).balance;\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle late payments\n    function handleLatePayment() external {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only borrower can report late payment.\");\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n\n        // Logic for handling late payment (e.g., penalties)\n        // For simplicity, we just emit an event\n        emit LatePayment(borrower, totalRepayment);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
