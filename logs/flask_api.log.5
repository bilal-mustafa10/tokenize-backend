2024-07-31 08:55:29,026 INFO: {"document": {"contract_type": null, "contract_requirements": null, "documentation": "# LoanContract Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThe `LoanContract` is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate the lending and borrowing of Ether (ETH) between a lender and a borrower. It provides a structured framework for initiating loans, calculating repayment amounts, and managing the loan lifecycle, including handling late payments.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to create a transparent and secure mechanism for peer-to-peer lending on the Ethereum blockchain. By utilizing smart contract technology, it eliminates the need for intermediaries, ensuring that both parties can engage in a trustless transaction.\n\n## Objectives\nThe contract aims to achieve the following objectives:\n- **Facilitate Loan Transactions:** Allow users to initiate and manage loans directly on the blockchain.\n- **Automate Repayment Calculations:** Automatically calculate the total repayment amount based on the loan amount and interest rate.\n- **Track Loan Status:** Maintain a clear record of the loan status, including whether it is active, repaid, or late.\n- **Handle Late Payments:** Provide functionality to manage and record late payments, ensuring accountability for both parties.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Loan Initialization:** The lender can set up a loan by specifying the loan amount, interest rate, and term. The borrower can then initiate the loan.\n- **Total Repayment Calculation:** The contract can calculate the total repayment amount, which includes the principal and interest, ensuring transparency in the lending process.\n- **Loan Repayment:** The borrower can repay the loan in full, and the contract will update the loan status accordingly.\n- **Remaining Balance Inquiry:** The borrower can check the remaining balance of the loan, providing clarity on their obligations.\n- **Late Payment Handling:** If the borrower fails to repay the loan by the deadline, the contract can record the late payment status, ensuring that both parties are aware of the consequences.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits several events to provide transparency and track important actions:\n- **LoanInitiated:** Emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, capturing the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate.\n- **LoanRepaid:** Emitted when the loan is repaid, indicating the amount repaid by the borrower.\n- **LatePayment:** Emitted when a payment is late, documenting the amount that was due at the time of the late payment.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust solution for facilitating loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating key processes and providing clear tracking of loan status, it enhances the lending experience for both borrowers and lenders. The use of events ensures that all actions are transparent and verifiable, contributing to a trustless lending environment.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables to store loan details\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanTerm;\n    bool public loanActive;\n    uint public totalRepayment;\n    uint public repaymentAmount;\n    uint public repaymentDeadline;\n\n    // Enum to track loan status\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Late }\n    LoanStatus public loanStatus;\n\n    // Event emitted when the loan is initiated\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    // Event emitted when the loan is repaid\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n    // Event emitted when a payment is late\n    event LatePayment(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan details\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 10 ether; // 10 ETH\n        interestRate = 3; // 3%\n        loanTerm = 365 days; // 1 year\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Active;\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(!loanActive, \"Loan is already active.\");\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        loanActive = true;\n        totalRepayment = loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n        repaymentAmount = totalRepayment; // Full repayment amount after 1 year\n        repaymentDeadline = block.timestamp + loanTerm;\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment;\n    }\n\n    // Function to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(msg.value == repaymentAmount, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n        require(block.timestamp <= repaymentDeadline, \"Payment is late.\");\n\n        loanActive = false;\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to check remaining balance of the loan\n    function remainingBalance() external view returns (uint) {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        return totalRepayment - repaymentAmount;\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle late payments\n    function handleLatePayment() external {\n        require(loanActive, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        require(block.timestamp > repaymentDeadline, \"Payment is not late.\");\n\n        loanStatus = LoanStatus.Late;\n        emit LatePayment(borrower, repaymentAmount);\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
