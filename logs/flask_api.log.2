It allows the borrower to initiate a loan, repay it with interest, and provides mechanisms for handling defaults.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `LoanContract` is to automate the process of lending and borrowing funds in a decentralized manner. It ensures that both parties adhere to the terms of the loan agreement, including the repayment of the principal amount along with interest, while also providing a way to manage defaults.\n\n## Objectives\nThe contract aims to achieve the following objectives:\n- **Facilitate Loan Transactions:** Enable users to borrow and lend funds securely and transparently.\n- **Automate Repayment Calculations:** Automatically calculate the total repayment amount based on the loan amount and interest rate.\n- **Manage Loan Status:** Track the status of the loan (active, repaid, or defaulted) to ensure proper handling of each scenario.\n- **Event Logging:** Emit events to provide a transparent record of loan initiation and repayment activities.\n\n## Functionalities\nThe `LoanContract` includes several key functionalities:\n- **Loan Initialization:** The lender sets the loan parameters, including the loan amount, interest rate, and duration. The borrower can initiate the loan by calling the `initiateLoan` function, which registers their address as the borrower.\n- **Repayment Process:** The borrower can repay the loan using the `repayLoan` function, which checks that the repayment amount matches the calculated total repayment and updates the loan status accordingly.\n- **Default Handling:** The lender can invoke the `handleDefault` function to manage situations where the borrower fails to repay the loan within the specified duration, marking the loan as defaulted.\n- **Interest Calculation:** The contract includes a function to calculate the total repayment amount, which includes the original loan amount plus interest, ensuring clarity in repayment obligations.\n\n## Events\nThe contract emits the following events:\n- **LoanInitiated:** This event is emitted when a loan is successfully initiated, capturing the borrower's address, loan amount, and interest rate. It serves as a record of the loan agreement.\n- **LoanRepaid:** This event is emitted when the borrower repays the loan, providing a record of the repayment transaction and the amount paid.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `LoanContract` serves as a robust framework for managing loans on the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the loan process, it reduces the need for intermediaries, enhances transparency, and provides a secure environment for both borrowers and lenders. The contract's functionalities, including loan initiation, repayment, and default handling, ensure that all parties can engage in lending activities with confidence.", "contract": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.26;\n\ncontract LoanContract {\n    // State variables to store loan details\n    address public borrower;\n    address public lender;\n    uint public loanAmount;\n    uint public interestRate;\n    uint public loanDuration;\n    uint public totalRepayment;\n    enum LoanStatus { Active, Repaid, Defaulted }\n    LoanStatus public status;\n\n    // Event emitted when a loan is initiated\n    event LoanInitiated(address indexed borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate);\n    // Event emitted when a loan is repaid\n    event LoanRepaid(address indexed borrower, uint amount);\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the loan contract\n    constructor(address _lender) {\n        lender = _lender;\n        loanAmount = 0.000001 ether; // Loan amount of 0.000001 ETH\n        interestRate = 5; // Interest rate of 5%\n        loanDuration = 1 days; // Loan duration of 1 day\n        status = LoanStatus.Active; // Initial loan status\n    }\n\n    // Function to initiate the loan\n    function initiateLoan() external {\n        require(msg.sender != lender, \"Lender cannot be the borrower.\");\n        borrower = msg.sender;\n        emit LoanInitiated(borrower, loanAmount, interestRate);\n    }\n\n    // Function to calculate total repayment amount after 1 day\n    function calculateTotalRepayment() public view returns (uint) {\n        return loanAmount + (loanAmount * interestRate / 100);\n    }\n\n    // Function for the borrower to repay the loan\n    function repayLoan() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == borrower, \"Only the borrower can repay the loan.\");\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        totalRepayment = calculateTotalRepayment();\n        require(msg.value == totalRepayment, \"Incorrect repayment amount.\");\n\n        // Mark loan as repaid\n        status = LoanStatus.Repaid;\n        emit LoanRepaid(borrower, msg.value);\n    }\n\n    // Function to handle default scenarios\n    function handleDefault() external {\n        require(msg.sender == lender, \"Only the lender can handle defaults.\");\n        require(status == LoanStatus.Active, \"Loan is not active.\");\n        // Logic for handling default (e.g., penalties, loss of collateral)\n        status = LoanStatus.Defaulted;\n    }\n}", "compiler_version": "0.8.26"}} [in /Users/bilal/Documents/comsc/kings/individual-project/Tokenize/backend/app/ai/routes.py:119]
